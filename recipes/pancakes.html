            <li>Put the flour in a large mixing bowl and slowly stir in the milk</li>
            <li>Keep stirring until you have a smooth, thin batter</li>
            <li>Add the aguafaba or flaxseed mix to the batter and stir until you see bubbles</li>
            <li>Heat a nice cube of butter in a frying pan and cover the entire surface of the pan with it</li>
            <li>When the butter is hot, add a ladle of batter to the pan and swirl it around until the entire pan is covered</li>
            <li>You can add in sliced apple, vegan bacon or vegan cheese if you like</li>
            <li>When the top of the pancake is dry, flip it over and bake the other side</li>
            <li>While baking the next one, keep the finished pancakes warm in the oven</li>
            <li>Repeat until you have no batter left</li>
            <li>Add your favourite toppings. Hint: the Dutch mainly use regular thick syrup and powdered sugar and roll them up!</li>
