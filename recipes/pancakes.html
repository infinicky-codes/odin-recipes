            <ol class="list">
                <li> Put the flour in a large mixing bowl and slowly stir in the milk</li>
                <li> Keep stirring until you have a smooth, thin batter</li>
                <li> Add the aguafaba or flaxseed mix to the batter and stir until you see bubbles</li>
                <li> Heat a nice cube of butter in a frying pan and cover the entire surface of the pan with it</li>
                <li> When the butter is hot, add a ladle of batter to the pan and swirl it around until the entire pan is covered</li>
                <li> You can add in sliced apple, vegan bacon or vegan cheese if you like</li>
                <li> When the top of the pancake is dry, flip it over and bake the other side</li>
                <li> While baking the next one, keep the finished pancakes warm in the oven</li>
                <li> Repeat until you have no batter left</li>
                <li> Add your favourite toppings. 
                    Hint: the Dutch mainly use regular thick syrup and powdered sugar and roll them up!</li>
