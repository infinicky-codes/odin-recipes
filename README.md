# Foundations Course: HTML Foundations Project
Basic recipe website built for The Odin Project. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes and wonâ€™t look very pretty, as it is made with HTML only. 

This is also a first project to practice the git workflow and writing clear commit messages.
