# Odin Recipes
Basic recipe website built for the Odin Project's Foundations Course: HTML Foundations. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes and wonâ€™t look very pretty, as it is made with HTML only. 

This is also a first project to practice the git workflow and writing clear messages for atomic commits.
